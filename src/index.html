    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Student and Software Engineer</h3>
<p>My name is Trevor Jex and I graduated from American Fork High School on May 31, 2018. I begin studying at Brigham Young
    University in the fall of 2018. I have a passion for learning, creating and designing.</p>
  <p>My favorite languages are Python and JavaScript. I love web design, especially when it comes to CSS or websockets, and I love Linux as well as Android.</p>
  <p>My hobbies include playing the piano, playing tennis and frisbee, listening to new-age music, going on dates, and
    designing innovative apps and programs.

    @PROJECT:projectid=automation,,projecttitle=Automation,,projectimage=automation.jpg,,projecttitlecaps=AUTOMATION,,projecturl=https://github.com/jextrevor/Automation,,projectdesc=<p>Automation is a automatic music player and alarm clock for the Raspberry Pi. Capabilities include the following:</p>    <ul>      <li>Automatic starting of music when movement in the room is detected (using the Raspberry Pi camera)</li>      <li>Automatic adjustment to slight changes in environment (gradual changing of light due to the sun, camera noise)</li>      <li>Music alarm at a certain time, time is changeable through the web interface</li>      <li>Notification LED when the program is "talking" (using the Raspberry Pi Camera LED)</li>      <li>Statement of the weather forecast for the day when the alarm is played (cloudy, partly cloudy, sunny, etc.)</li>      <li>Statement of how many unread emails the user has when music starts</li>      <li>User-settable reminders</li>      <li>Web interface to toggle alarm status, play or pause music, upload new music, and set reminders</li></ul><p>The project is written in Python and is designed to run on the Model B. To run on newer models such as the B+ or Pi 2 you must change the CAMLED variable in the code to the GPIO port associated with the camera LED (32 for B+ or 2, 40 for Pi Zero).</p>,,@
